1. Try running the .exe-file. If it works, great! If it doesn't, see further steps below.
2. If you get error messages complaining about missing files, specifically called "vcruntime140d.dll" or "ucrtbased.dll", don't fret! They are located in the folders called '32' and '64'.
   All you need to do is copy the contents of '32' to your native 'System32'-folder, and the same for '64' to 'SysWOW64'. They should both be located at "C:\Windows".
3. If it STILL doesn't work, we'd LOVE to hear about it.
	3.1. If the error messages specify any other files missing, you could either download it yourself online if you know what you're doing, or you could tell us to let us try solve it.
	3.2. Any other error that doesn't imply missing files can be reported to us for fixing.

There are currently 5 different visualizers. Each one is accessed by pressing the '0-4' keys, with the 0th being the default choice upon start.

The 'r'-key interacts with SOME of the visualizers:
	0. Resets the sensitivity of the visualizer. E.g. If you listen to a low-volume song, after a relatively high-volume song, the effects might be a little weak. Pressing 'r' at this
	   point makes the effects strong again.
	1. -
	2. The fishes can be toggled with the 'r'-key to act wacky. Try out for yourself, and you'll notice the difference.
	3. -
	4. The bars from the circle can be toggled between two different distributions with the 'r'-key.

When you're finished using the visualizer and want to turn it off, the 'esc'-key shuts it down. You'll need to shut down the terminal window down yourself after.
